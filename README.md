## üöÄ Development Journey
### Planning & Design
My portfolio website development began with careful planning and design considerations:

Requirements Gathering: I identified the key sections needed - Home, Projects, Skills, Resume, and Contact.

Design: I chose a clean, professional aesthetic with: Consistent color scheme, Responsive layout for all device sizes, Dark/light mode for accessibility, Interactive elements for engagement

Technology Selection: I selected React and Vite for performance, along with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and consistent design language.

Implementation Process
My development approach followed these phases:

Project Setup: Initialized a Vite project with React and configured Tailwind CSS.
Component Structure: Created modular, reusable components for each section.
Data Architecture: Separated content from presentation by storing project and resume data in structured JS files.
Responsive Design: Implemented mobile-first design principles with Tailwind's responsive classes.
Interactive Features: Added animations, hover effects, and the typewriter component to create an engaging user experience.
Dark Mode: Implemented theme detection and toggle functionality with CSS variables.
Testing & Refinement: Tested across multiple browsers and screen sizes, refining UI elements for optimal user experience.

### Content Customization

- **Projects**: Added the `src/data/projectsData.js` file to store project information
- **Resume**: Added the `src/data/resumeData.js` file to store experience and skills
- **Profile Information**: Updated personal details in appropriate component files

## üåê Deployment
